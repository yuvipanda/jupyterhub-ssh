# This schema (a jsonschema in YAML format) is used to generate

# validation by Helm of values before template rendering.
#
# This schema is also used by our documentation system to build the
# configuration reference section based on the description fields. See
# doc/source/conf.py for that logic!
#
# We look to document everything we have default values for in values.yaml, but
# we don't look to enforce the perfect validation logic within this file.

          The Jupyter ecosystem's Python classes expose configuration through
          [_traitlets_](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and this
          Helm chart config represented as _static_ YAML values will be directly
          mapped to updating such traitlet configuration.

          __Example__

          If you inspect documentation for JupyterHubSSH the Python class to
          describing it can be configured like:

          ```python
          c.JupyterHubSSH.debug = true
          ```

          Then in this Helm chart, the equivalent configuration would be like
          this:

          ```yaml
          hub:
            config:
              JupyterHubSSH:
                debug: true
          ```
