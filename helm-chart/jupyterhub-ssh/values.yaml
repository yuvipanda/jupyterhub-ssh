# nameOverride if set, will override the name of the chart in two contexts.

nameOverride: ""
# fullnameOverride set to a truthy value will make all k8s resources be named
# <fullnameOverride> with an optional prefix. But if fullnameOverride is set to
# a falsy value will make all k8s resource names become either <release
# name>-<chart name> with an optional suffix, or <release name> with an optional
# suffix. The chart name part is excluded if release name is found to contain
# the chart name.
