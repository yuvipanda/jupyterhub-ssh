# hostKey is a private SSH key used to encrypt outgoing communication from the
# jupyterhub-ssh and jupyterhub-sftp pods. If this value is blank, whatever was
# used previously will be used, but if nothing has been used previously a RSA
# 4086 key will be generated.

# nameOverride if set, will override the name of the chart in two contexts.
# 1. The label: app.kubernetes.io/name: <chart name>
# 2. The Helm template function: jupyterhub-ssh.fullname, if fullnameOverride
#    isn't set because then it takes precedence.
nameOverride: ""
# fullnameOverride set to a truthy value will make all k8s resources be named
# <fullnameOverride> with an optional prefix. But if fullnameOverride is set to
# a falsy value will make all k8s resource names become either <release
# name>-<chart name> with an optional suffix, or <release name> with an optional
# suffix. The chart name part is excluded if release name is found to contain
# the chart name.
